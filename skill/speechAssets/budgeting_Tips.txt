Here is a budgeting tip for you

Try the simple 50, 15, 5 rule! Use 50% of your monthly take-home-pay towards basic necessities, like rent and groceries, 15% towards retirement savings, and 5% towards an emergency fund for unexpected costs. Then you can use the remaining 30% towards anything you'd like!
